* Add a tokenizer that works like an iterator (for the cases when the user knows it will
tokenize a string completely)
* Add more templates like operator<< (+ for example)

* Add "[...]" sections to cConfig, make them available as a third (optional) parameter
in GetKeyValue. Default value would be "" (global scope). exposeData()
should be modified accordingly (dunno how yet), as retrocompatible as
possible.
